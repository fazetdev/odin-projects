# 🛠️ Odin Foundations Lab – Indie Dev Buildlog

This repo is my personal dev lab for everything from **The Odin Project – Foundations path**.  
Every folder here contains a project I built from scratch — no copy-paste, just focused learning and iteration.

## 🎯 Purpose

This isn’t just about finishing a course — it’s about learning to **build independently**.

I’m approaching each project like a real-world deliverable: breaking problems down, thinking in components, and refining through iteration. This repo tracks my growth and serves as a **launchpad** for future freelance or open-source work.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Write clean, semantic HTML
- Build responsive layouts with CSS (no frameworks)
- Understand JavaScript fundamentals deeply (no reliance on libraries)
- Practice version control and clean commits
- Get comfortable with manual setup (no code playgrounds or GUIs)
