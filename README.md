# 🌱 Odin Foundations Lab – Indie Dev Buildlog

Welcome to my personal dev lab for the [Odin Project – Foundations Path](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations).  
This repo is my focused journey from beginner to indie dev, where every folder contains a full project I built **from scratch** – no tutorials, no copy-paste. Just real learning and iteration.

## 🎯 Purpose

This isn’t just about finishing assignments — it’s about building confidence to **code independently**, like a real indie dev.  
Every project is approached as a **real-world deliverable**: planning, component thinking, clean UI/UX, and self-review.

---

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- ✅ Write clean, semantic HTML
- ✅ Build responsive layouts with pure CSS
- ✅ Understand JavaScript fundamentals deeply (no libraries)
- ✅ Practice version control and clean commits
- ✅ Get comfortable with manual file setup (no drag-and-drop builders)

---

## 🧪 How to Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fazetdev/odin-projects.git
cd odin-projects
# Open any project folder
cd 05-calculator
# Then open index.html in your browser
